It uses a hash function to compute an index, or hash code, into an array of buckets or slots. This index indicates where the desired value associated with a given key can be found.\n",

While modern Python versions preserve insertion order for dict objects, this ordering is a recent enhancement and not a fundamental requirement of the hash table data structure itself. The core mechanism still relies on hashing for efficient access."

        "Ans -Python strings are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed after creation. This design choice offers several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        " . Data Integrity and Safety: Immutability ensures that once a string is created, its value remains consistent. This prevents unintended modifications, especially when multiple parts of a program or different variables reference the same string object. If strings were mutable, changing a string through one reference could unexpectedly affect other references, leading to bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        " . Hashability: Immutable objects can be hashed, which is a requirement for using them as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets. The hash value of an object depends on its content, and if the content could change, the hash value would also change, making it impossible to reliably retrieve or locate the object in hash-based data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        " . Memory Optimization (String Interning): Python can optimize memory usage by \"interning\" common strings. If multiple variables are assigned the same string literal (e.g., s1 = \"hello\", s2 = \"hello\"), Python might store only one copy of \"hello\" in memory and have both s1 and s2 point to that same object. This is only safe because strings are immutable; if they were mutable, changing s1 would also change s2, which is usually not the desired behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        " . Thread Safety: In multi-threaded environments, immutable objects are inherently thread-safe because their state cannot be modified. This eliminates the need for complex locking mechanisms to protect against race conditions when multiple threads access the same string.\n",
        "\n",
        "When operations appear to \"modify\" a string, such as concatenation or replacement, a new string object is actually created with the updated content, and the variable is then reassigned to reference this new object.

        "The immutability of tuples is a fundamental characteristic that distinguishes them from mutable data types like lists. This design choice provides several benefits and implications:\n",

        "Ans - Lists are preferred over dictionaries in situations where:\n",
        "\n",
        " . Order of elements is important: Lists maintain the insertion order of elements, allowing for access and manipulation based on their positional index. If the sequence of items is crucial, such as a chronological log of events or an ordered list of tasks, a list is the appropriate choice.\n",

        "Ans - Dictionaries are considered unordered because they do not maintain the order in which items are inserted; they are a collection of key-value pairs optimized for fast retrieval of a value using its key, not for maintaining sequence. This affects data retrieval by making it impossible to access items by their insertion order (like a list index) but ensures that accessing a value by its unique key is extremely efficient.\n",

        "Why dictionaries are unordered\n",

        "\n",
        " . No implicit indexing: Unlike lists or tuples, you cannot refer to an item by its numerical position (e.g., index 0, 1, 2) because the items are not stored in a predictable sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        " . Optimized for speed: The main goal of the dictionary's design is to provide fast data retrieval based on the key, which is achieved through hashing. This optimization often comes at the cost of insertion order.\n",
